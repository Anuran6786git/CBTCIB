•The computer provides feedback, and the user continues guessing until they either correctly guess the number or exhaust their attempts.
•The game can be played in multiple rounds, and the user's score is updated after each round.

The flow of the project would be as follows:
•The MainClass prompts the user for authentication.
•Upon successful authentication, an ATM object is created.
